👋 Hi, I'm @ramseskamanda, I'm currently a freelance software engineer from Luxembourg 🇱🇺

👀 I’m interested in a lot of topics, mainly AI (especially RL), blockchain, and distributed computing. 
   I enjoy a good talk about pretty much anything computer related, but please don't talk to me about regex. 🙃

🌱 I’m currently learning more about peer2peer networks. Although if we're talking about specific technologies, I've really been into Go and Apache Beam.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the following repos (although I probably will never have time to contribute to all of them):

- [ ] [Apache Beam](https://github.com/apache/beam)
- [ ] [gvisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor)
- [ ] [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
- [ ] [Freely-wired Neural Networks](https://github.com/noahtren/Freewire)
- [ ] [Acme](https://github.com/deepmind/acme) 👨🏽‍💻 currently here
- [ ] [Ethereum's Go re-implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)

I'll introduce more projects as time goes on, including some of my own, so look forward to that 😏

📫 How to reach me: ramses.kamanda@gmail.com! (Does Github not have a way for people to get in contact with one another?)
