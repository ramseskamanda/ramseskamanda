👋 Hi, I'm @ramseskamanda, I'm currently a freelance software engineer from Luxembourg 🇱🇺

👀 I’m interested in a lot of topics, mainly AI (especially RL), blockchain, and distributed computing. 
   I enjoy a good talk about pretty much anything computer related, but please don't talk to me about regex. 🙃

🌱 I’m currently learning more about peer2peer networks. Although if we're talking about specific technologies, I've really been into Go and Apache Beam.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the following repos (although I probably will never have time to contribute to all of them):

- [ ] [Apache Beam](https://github.com/apache/beam)
- [ ] [gvisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor)
- [ ] [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
- [ ] [Freely-wired Neural Networks](https://github.com/noahtren/Freewire)
- [ ] [Acme](https://github.com/deepmind/acme) 👨🏽‍💻 currently here
- [ ] [Ethereum's Go re-implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)

My own projects (very happy to accept contributions if you find them useful):

- [x] [workon](https://github.com/ramseskamanda/workon) – A CLI startup script to pick what projects to work on
- [x] [easy_auth](https://github.com/ramseskamanda/easy_auth) – A Flutter package to manage your authentication state, as easily as possible
- [ ] [plasma](https://github.com/ramseskamanda/plasma) – A Firebase-like platform for data pipelines and data engineering

And there's more on the way!

I'll introduce more projects as time goes on, including some of my own, so look forward to that 😏

📫 How to reach me: ramses.kamanda@gmail.com! (Does Github not have a way for people to get in contact with one another?)
